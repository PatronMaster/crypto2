## Historical Cryptocurrency Prices For active and dead Tokens!

This is a modification of the original crypto package by [jesse vent](https://github.com/JesseVent/crypto). It allows to additionally retrieve historic (and possibly dead) coins for research puposes

- Retrieves historical crypto currency data `crypto_history()`
- Retrieves list of all active/dead crypto currencies `crypto_list()`
- Retrieves all available meta information for a list of coin slugs `crypto_info()`

### Prerequisites

Below are the high level dependencies for the package to install correctly.

```
R (>= 3.4.0), rvest, xml2

# Ubuntu 
sudo apt install libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev
```

### Installing

The _crypto2_ R-package is installable through CRAN or through github.

# Installing via Github

```
