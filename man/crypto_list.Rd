\title{Retrieves name, cmc id, symbol, slug, rank, an activity flas as well as activity dates on cmc for all coins}
\usage{
crypto_list(api_key, only_active = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{api_key}{API-key (only needs the free basic plan) but impossible without}

\item{only_active}{Shall the code only retrieve active coins (TRUE=default) or include inactive coins (FALSE)}
}
\value{
List of (active and historically existing) cryptocurrencies in a tibble:
  \item{id}{CMC id (unique identifier)}
  \item{symbol}{Coin symbol (not-unique)}
  \item{name}{Coin name}
  \item{slug}{Coin URL slug (unique)}
  \item{rank}{Current rank on CMC (if still active)}
  \item{first_historical_data}{First time listed on CMC}
  \item{last_historical_data}{Last time listed on CMC, NA if still listed}

Required dependency that is used in function call \code{getCoins()}.
}
\description{
This code uses the api but is based on the free plan and therefore all data should be easily available.
It retrieves data for all historic and all active coins!! But it requires an existing (and free) API key.
This function replaces the old function \code{crypto_list()} (still available as \code{crypto_list_old()}
which does not work anymore due to the "load more" button that I could ot figure out)
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# return all coins
coin_list <- crypto_list(api_key=..., only_active=FALSE)

# return all coins listed in 2015
coin_list_2015 <- coin_list \%>\%
dplyr::filter(first_historical_data<="2015-12-31",
last_historical_data>="2015-01-01")

}
